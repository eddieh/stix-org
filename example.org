You're viewing the Org example document exported to HTML with the STIX
Org theme. Return the [[https://github.com/eddieh/stix-org][STIX Org on GitHub]].
#+END_aside

* Front Matter

Org files should begin with front matter. The special front matter
comments control many aspects of an Org file. Some special are
rendered when exported, some control meta data, some control how Org
works or set options and configurations. These special comments have
the form =#+NAME: value(s)=


** Title and Date

At the very least an Org document should begin with a title and a
date. For example the first two lines of this file are

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+TITLE: Example Org File
  ,#+DATE: 2020-01-31
#+END_SRC


* Headings

Headings structure documents into sections and subsections. They begin
with an =*= and the number of asterisks denote the heading level. The
top or first level begins with one asterisks followed by the section
title and the syntax is =* Section Title=. A second level heading begins with
two asterisks followed by the subsection title and the syntax is =**
Subsection Title=.

HTML has only six heading levels, but an Org document can have many
more. In fact Org has 8 heading faces defined, but has a constant
called =org-indent--deepest-level= that implies 50 or more levels are
possible.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defconst org-indent--deepest-level 50
    "Maximum theoretical headline depth.")
#+END_SRC

However, the max export depth is 19.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defconst org-export-max-depth 19
    "Maximum nesting depth for headlines, counting from 0.")
#+END_SRC

Since HTML supports only six levels we'll show that many as an
example. Org will happily create =<hn>= headings for /n/-level
headings with \( n > 6 \).

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,* Top or first level headline
  Curabitur blandit tempus ardua ridiculus sed magna.
  ,** Second level
  Me non paenitet nullum festiviorem excogitasse ad hoc.
  ,*** Third level
  Ab illo tempore, ab est sed immemorabili.
  ,**** Forth level
  Sed haec quis possit intrepidus aestimare tellus.
  ,***** Fifth level
  Nihil hic munitissimus habendi senatus locus, nihil horum?
  ,****** Sixth level
  Quae vero auctorem tractata ab fiducia dicuntur.
#+END_SRC

* Top or first level headline
Curabitur blandit tempus ardua ridiculus sed magna.

** Second level
Me non paenitet nullum festiviorem excogitasse ad hoc.

*** Third level
Ab illo tempore, ab est sed immemorabili.

**** Forth level
Sed haec quis possit intrepidus aestimare tellus.

***** Fifth level
Nihil hic munitissimus habendi senatus locus, nihil horum?

****** Sixth level
Quae vero auctorem tractata ab fiducia dicuntur.


* Tables

Tables in Org use a sensible syntax that looks great in plain
text. The tables look even better in HTML thanks to [[https://github.com/gongzhitaao/orgcss][OrgCSS]]. The Org
syntax is self-evident from the example

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  | Name  | Phone | Age |
  |-------+-------+-----|
  | Peter |  1234 |  17 |
  | Anna  |  4321 |  25 |
#+END_SRC

Which produces this table

| Name  | Phone | Age |
|-------+-------+-----|
| Peter |  1234 |  17 |
| Anna  |  4321 |  25 |

Tables without headers are supported too. Just omit the horizontal
divider line.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  | 2 | 4 |
  | 4 | 2 |
#+END_SRC

Which produces the table

| 2 | 4 |
| 4 | 2 |


** Column Alignment

Consider the payoff matrix for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors][Roshambo]]. If we want player one's
options to be represented by the first column and aligned right while
player two's options are represented by the first row and center
aligned, we can get a decent looking payoff matrix with the following
markup in Org

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  |          | Rock | Paper | Sissors |
  |      <r> | <c>  |  <c>  |   <c>   |
  |     Rock |  0   |  -1   |    1    |
  |    Paper |  1   |   0   |   -1    |
  | Scissors |  -1  |   1   |    0    |
#+END_SRC

Which produces the following table

|          | Rock | Paper | Sissors |
|      <r> | <c>  |  <c>  |   <c>   |
|     Rock |  0   |  -1   |    1    |
|    Paper |  1   |   0   |   -1    |
| Scissors |  -1  |   1   |    0    |

As can bee seen above, columns can be aligned right with =<r>=,
aligned center with =<c>=, and aligned left with =<l>=.

# Complex table (a playoff matrix for Roshambo)
#+BEGIN_COMMENT
+-------------------+-------------------+
|                   |     Player 2      |
|                   +-----+-----+-------+
|                   |Rock |Paper|Sissors|
+----------+--------+-----+-----+-------+
|          |    Rock|  0  | -1  |   1   |
|          +--------+-----+-----+-------+
|Player 1  |   Paper|  1  |  0  |  -1   |
|          +--------+-----+-----+-------+
|          | Sissors| -1  |  1  |   0   |
+----------+--------+-----+-----+-------+
#+END_COMMENT


** Table Captions

A table with a caption is easy to produce. Consider the magic square
of order 3. We can compute the magic constant for magic square of
order /n/ using the formula \(M = n (n^2 + 1) / 2 \). This give us a
magic constant of 15 for the order 3 magic square. We can construct
the magic square in Org with a caption like so

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+NAME: tbl:ms-o3
  ,#+CAPTION: Magic Square of Order 3
  ,#+ATTR_HTML: :width 25%
  | <c> | <c> | <c> |
  |  2  |  7  |  6  |
  |  9  |  5  |  1  |
  |  4  |  3  |  8  |
#+END_SRC

#+NAME: tbl:ms-o3
#+CAPTION: Magic Square of Order 3
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 25%
| <c> | <c> | <c> |
|  2  |  7  |  6  |
|  9  |  5  |  1  |
|  4  |  3  |  8  |


* Source Blocks

An Org source block containing an Emacs Lisp function called
=mccarthy91=.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (defun mccarthy91 (n)
       "McCarthy 91 is used as a formal verification test case."
       (if (<= n 100)
           (mccarthy91 (mccarthy91 (+ n 11)))
         (- n 10)))
  ,#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC

Renders to HTML like so

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun mccarthy91 (n)
     "McCarthy 91 is used as a formal verification test case."
     (if (<= n 100)
         (mccarthy91 (mccarthy91 (+ n 11)))
       (- n 10)))
#+END_SRC

** Long lines

The next code block is used to check if the styling can display an 80
character lines without overflow. The block is made up of lines
contains the first 80 characters of a base-85 encoding called [[https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:32/Z85/][Z85]].

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.-:+=^!/*?&<>()[]{
  0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.-:+=^!/*?&<>()[]{
  0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.-:+=^!/*?&<>()[]{
#+END_SRC

Now we must check how a code block that with overflow looks.

#+begin_src objc
  + (nullable NSURL *)URLForResource:(nullable NSString *)name withExtension:(nullable NSString *)ext subdirectory:(nullable NSString *)subpath inBundleWithURL:(NSURL *)bundleURL API_AVAILABLE(macos(10.6), ios(4.0), watchos(2.0), tvos(9.0));
#+end_src


* Formatting

Want something *bold* use =*bold*=. Want something /italic/ use
=/italic/=. Want something _underlined_ use =_underlined_=. Want
something +strikethrough+ use =+strikethrough+=. And lastly, want
something =monospaced= use ~=monospaced=~ or =~monospaced~=.


** Subscripts and Superscripts

Text characters set below or above the line of type for a font/size
combination are necessary for technical writing. Subscripts and
superscripts are achieved in the same way as in TeX or LaTeX.

The radius of the sun is R_{sun} = 6.96 \times 10^{8} m.  On the other
hand, the radius of Alpha Centauri is R_{Alpha Centauri} = 1.28 \times
R_{sun}.


** Special Symbols

There are many special symbols and non-Latin alphabets that can be
inserted in an Org document. The syntax is like TeX or LaTeX too.

Given a circle \Gamma of diameter d, the length of its circumference
is \pi{}d. We can type \alpha as =\alpha=, \beta as =\beta=, and \chi
as =\chi=. If you need a symbol in a word or formula it can be
terminated with a pair of curly braces, so the previous \pi{}d is
achived by typing =\pi{}d=.

Some other symbols include \copy as =\copy=, \dag as =\dag=, and
\times as seen in the subscript/superscript section above as
=\times=. There's \pm as =\pm= or =\plusmn=. There's \frac12 as
=\frac12= and there's \frac34 as =\frac34=. There's x \to \infin,
typed as =x \to \infin=. Don't forget the en dash -- or the em dash
---, respectively =--= and =---=.

Get a list of special symbols with =org-entities-help= or you can add
your own in the variable =org-entities-user=.


* Lists

Some technology that relies on quantum physics include

- Lasers
- Solar cells
- Xerox machines and laser printers
- Transistors
- Integrated circuits
- Digital cameras
- Supercondoctors

Programming languages

1. C
2. Objective-C
3. Python
4. JavaScript
5. Scheme (or LISP)
6. Ruby
7. Shell script

List of lists

- Unordered list items may begin with
  - dash =-=
  - plus =+=
  - asterisk =*=
- Ordered list items may begin with
    - a number followed by a period =1.=
    - a number followed by a parenthesis =1)=

Definition lists

- Proposition :: A statement that is either /true/ or /false/
- True :: Agreement with fact or reality
- False :: Conflicting with fact or reality


* Math

Math (and music) are universal languages. Any system for preparing
documents must provide facilities for writing and displaying math.

The set of natural numbers \( 1, 2, 3, ..., \infty \) is represented
by the symbol \( \mathbb{N} \). The set of itegers \( -\infty, ...,
-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ..., \infty \) is represented by the symbol \(
\mathbb{Z} \). The letter Z comes from Zahlen, the German word for
numbers.

Here are some properties of integers:

The set \(\mathbb{Z}\) is closed under addition

\[ a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \implies a + b \in \mathbb{Z} \]

The set \(\mathbb{Z}\) is closed under subtraction

\[ a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \implies a - b \in \mathbb{Z} \]

And the set \(\mathbb{Z}\) is closed under multiplication

\[ a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \implies a \times b \in \mathbb{Z} \]


** Notation

Inline math such as \(a^2\) is inserted when \(\LaTeX\) is delimited
by =\(= ... =\)=. Whereas display math is inserted when \(\LaTeX\) is
delimited by =\[= ... =\]=. Consider \(n \ge 1, F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1\),
then we can express a recurrence relation in dispaly math as

\[ F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1} \]






** Logical Proposition

Given a proposition \( P \) and a proposition \( Q \) we can define
some logical modifiers, combinatory terms, and relations using /truth
tables/. We will denote /true/ with a T and /false/ with a F.


*** Defining /Not/

The propisiotn \( P \) and its complement \( \neg P \), read /not P/,
are defined by the truth table:

| \( P \) | \( \neg P \) |
|---------+--------------|
| T       | F            |
| F       | T            |


*** Defining /And/

Given a proposition \( P \) and a proposition \( Q \) the logical
conjunction \( P \land Q \), read /P and Q/, is defined by the truth
table:

| \( P \) | \( Q \) | \( P \land Q \) |
|---------+---------+-----------------|
| T       | T       | T               |
| T       | F       | F               |
| F       | T       | F               |
| F       | F       | F               |


*** Defining /Or/

Given a proposition \( P \) and a proposition \( Q \) the logical
disjunction \( P \lor Q \), read /P or Q/, is defined by the truth
table:

| \( P \) | \( Q \) | \( P \lor Q \) |
|---------+---------+-----------------|
| T       | T       | T               |
| T       | F       | T               |
| F       | T       | T               |
| F       | F       | F               |


*** Defining /Xor/

Given a proposition \( P \) and a proposition \( Q \) the logical
exclusive disjunction \( P \oplus Q \), read /P exlusive or Q/, is
defined by the truth table:

| \( P \) | \( Q \) | \( P \oplus Q \) |
|---------+---------+------------------|
| T       | T       | F                |
| T       | F       | T                |
| F       | T       | T                |
| F       | F       | F                |

/Notation note:/ the symbol \( \veebar \) is an alternative to \(
\oplus \).


** Sums

The following is a summation with index /k/ from 1 to /n/ - 1.

\[ \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} a_k = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 ... + a_{n-1} \]

The following is a summation with index /j/ from 0 to /n/ - 1.

\[ \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x^j = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ... + x^{n-1} \]


* Images

The first image is of the Wallpaper Groups also called the Plane
Symmetry Groups or the Plane Crystallographic Groups it is taken from
a paper published in American Mathematical Monthly titled [[https://www.math.fsu.edu/~quine/MB_10/schattschneider.pdf][The Plane
Symmetry Groups: Their Recognition and Notation]].

#+NAME: fig:wg
#+CAPTION: The 17 Wallpaper Groups
#+ATTR_HTML: :class fill-width :alt All 17 wallpaper groups

The next image should not stretch.

#+NAME: fig:cw
#+CAPTION: Color Wheel
#+ATTR_HTML: :class natural-width :alt A color wheel
[[./img/color-wheel.png]]


* Horizontal Rules

incolunt Belgae, aliam Aquitani, tertiam. Contra legem facit qui id

* Links

We need hypertext, it's the web after all. The Org link format is
simple, either =[link]= or =[[link][description]]=. There are some
[[https://orgmode.org/org.html#Link-Format][escaping concerns]] so it is best to always insert or edit a link with
=C-c C-l=.


** External Links

There are a number of external links in this document. Org can link to
many different types of resources. The two most common types of
resources are web links "https" (or "http") and "file" links.

A clickable URL to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences
follows [[https://oeis.org]]. The next example is a descriptive link to
the [[https://dlmf.nist.gov][NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions]].

# The next link doesn't seem to work when exporting although it works
# with C-c C-o

# A link to line 42 of your Emacs init file follows
# [[file:~/.emacs.d/init.el::42]].


** Internal Links

With an internal link we can refer to a previous section like the
section on [[*Math][Math]]. Or we can link to some named element such as [[fig:wg][the
wallpaper group figure]]. Or we can link to a section [[*Headings]] without
a description. Section links are of the form =[[*section
name][optional description]]=, or to use a section's custom ID to form
the link =[[#custom-id][optional description]]=, and to link to a
named entity use the form =[[entity-name][optional description]]=,
e.g. for the wallpaper group figure the link is formed with
=[[fig:wg][wallpaper group figure]]=.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It would be very nice if I could illustrate the various techniques
with small demonstration programs and could conclude with "... and
when faced with a program a thousand times as large, you compose it in
the same way." This common educational device, however, would be
self-defeating as one of my central themes will be that any two things
that differ in some respect by a factor of already a hundred or more,
are utterly incomparable.

History has shown that this truth is very hard to believe. Apparently
we are too much trained to disregard differences in scale, to treat
them as "gradual differences that are not essential." We tell
ourselves that what we can do once, we can also do twice and by
induction we fool ourselves into believing that we can do it as many
times as needed, but this is just not true! A factor of a thousand is
already far beyond our powers of imagination!

[...]

It is in the same mood that I should like to draw the reader's
attention to the fact that "clarity" has pronounced quantitative
aspects, a fact many mathematicians, curiously enough, seem to be
unaware of. A theorem stating the validity of a conclusion when ten
pages full of conditions are satisfied is hardly a convenient tool, as
all conditions have to be verified whenever the theorem is appealed
to. In Euclidean geometry, Pythagoras' Theorem holds for any three
points A, B and C such that through A and C a straight line can be
drawn orthogonal to a straight line through B and C. How many
mathematicians appreciate that the theorem remains applicable when
some or all of the points A, B and C coincide? Yet this seems largely
responsible for the convenience with which Pythagoras' Theorem can be
used. --- Edsger W. Dijkstra

* Footnotes and Endnotes

Technical writing requires many structures and organizational tools to
be effective. One of the quintessential structures in a technical
document are footnotes [fn:1].

Plura mihi bona sunt, inclinet, amari petere vellent. Quam diu etiam
furor iste tuus nos eludet? Qui ipsorum lingua Celtae, nostra Galli
appellantur [fn:2]. Vivamus sagittis lacus vel augue laoreet rutrum faucibus.
Salutantibus vitae elit libero, a pharetra augue.

** Footnote Syntax

Org footnotes are just links that start with =fn:=. The footnotes
may be numbered, named, anonymous and can be inline or defined in a
footnotes section. A numbered footnote looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
The Org homepage[fn:1] now looks a lot better than it used to.
...
[fn:1] The link is: https://orgmode.org
#+END_SRC

Named and anonymous footnotes look like these:

=[fn:name]=

A named footnote reference, where =name= is a unique label word, or,
for simplicity of automatic creation, a number.

=[fn:: This is the inline definition of this footnote]=

An anonymous footnote where the definition is given directly at the
reference point.

=[fn:name: a definition]=

An inline definition of a footnote, which also specifies a name for
the note. Since Org allows multiple references to the same note, you
can then use =[fn:name]= to create additional references.
