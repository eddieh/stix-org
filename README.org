Â _{unofficial} Scientific and Technical Information Exchange (STIX) theme
for Org HTML exporter.

I made this theme for the same reason the STIX font exists. The theme
is "intended to meet the demanding needs of authors, [developers,
readers, ...] and others in the scientific, medical, and technical
fields."

The STIX theme uses the [[https://github.com/stipub/stixfonts][STIX Fonts]] for body text and the [[https://dejavu-fonts.github.io][DejaVu Sans
Mono]] font for code. The fonts were selected because of their
comprehensive Unicode coverage. The theme incorporates elements from
the [[https://github.com/poole/lanyon][Lanyon]] for Jekyll theme, the [[https://github.com/gongzhitaao/orgcss][OrgCSS]] stylesheet for Org's HTML
exporter, and many other sources of beautiful minimalist documents.

The theme also uses [[https://katex.org][KaTeX]] over [[https://www.mathjax.org][MathJax]]. The reason is simple, MathJax
is big, slow---and hijacks your context menu. When a page uses
MathJax, you know it. The software that renders the math should be
unseen to the reader.

Copy the setup file =setup.org=, the =css/stix-org.css=, and
=css/htmlize-b16-ocean.css= to your local machine. Adjust URL/paths in
the setup file to point to your copies of =stix-org.css= and
=htmlize-b16-ocean.css= as needed.

#+BEGIN_SRC org

Add the =#+SETUPFILE:= directive to the frontmatter of your Org
documents and adjust the URL/path to point to your copy of the
=setup.org= file as needed.

default browser.
