#+DESCRIPTION: Scientific and Technical Information Exchange theme for Org
#+KEYWORDS: org html theme stix
#+SETUPFILE: setup.org

¬†_{unofficial} Scientific and Technical Information Exchange (STIX) theme
for Org HTML exporter.

I made this theme for the same reason the STIX font exists. The theme
is "intended to meet the demanding needs of authors, [developers,
readers, ...] and others in the scientific, medical, and technical
fields."

The STIX theme uses the [[https://github.com/stipub/stixfonts][STIX Fonts]] for body text and the [[https://dejavu-fonts.github.io][DejaVu Sans
Mono]] font for code. The fonts were selected because of their
comprehensive Unicode coverage. The theme incorporates elements from
the [[https://github.com/poole/lanyon][Lanyon]] for Jekyll theme, the [[https://github.com/gongzhitaao/orgcss][OrgCSS]] stylesheet for Org's HTML
exporter, and many other sources of beautiful minimalist documents.

The theme also uses [[https://katex.org][KaTeX]] over [[https://www.mathjax.org][MathJax]]. The reason is simple, MathJax
is big, slow---and hijacks your context menu. When a page uses
MathJax, you know it. The software that renders the math should be
unseen to the reader.

with this theme]].

** Usage

Add these lines to your Emacs init file

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-html-html5-fancy t)
  (setq org-html-head-include-default-style nil)
  (setq org-html-head-include-scripts nil)
  (setq org-html-htmlize-output-type 'css)
  (setq org-html-toplevel-hlevel 1)
#+END_SRC

Copy the setup file =setup.org=, the =css/stix-org.css=, and
=css/htmlize-b16-ocean.css= to your local machine. Adjust URL/paths in
the setup file to point to your copies of =stix-org.css= and
=htmlize-b16-ocean.css= as needed.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" href="path-to/stix-org.css">
  ,#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" href="path-to/htmlize-b16-ocean.css">
#+END_SRC

Add the =#+SETUPFILE:= directive to the frontmatter of your Org
documents and adjust the URL/path to point to your copy of the
=setup.org= file as needed.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+TITLE: STIX Org
  ,#+DATE: 2020-01-30
  # ...
  ,#+SETUPFILE: path-to/setup.org
#+END_SRC

Now =C-c C-e h o= to export the Org file to HTML and open it in your
default browser.


*** Requirements

- Emacs 26.3
- [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]] version 9.3.1
- [[https://github.com/hniksic/emacs-htmlize][htmlize]] 1.55


** Organization

The repo is a little crowded, but here is a rundown of the files and
directories.


*** Theme files

The only files need to use the theme are the two CSS files from the
=css= directory and the =setup.org= file.

- =css/htmlize-b16-ocean.css=
- =css/stix-org.css=
- =setup.org=


*** Example document

The example document is an Org file that contains many features,
structures, and markup supported by Org. The document is a good base
for developing a theme and hopefully, others will use it as such.

- =example.org=

View the exported example document using this theme [[https://eddieh.github.io/stix-org][here]].


*** Git & GitHub stuff

Stuff the repository need and GitHub needs like the README and stuff
for GitHub Pages.

- =docs/=
- =img/=
- =resources/=
- =.gitattributes=
- =.gitignore=
- =README.org=
- =todo.org=


*** Build support

Right now the build support only builds the GitHub pages, but assuming
there's interest beyond my own ü§û, it will contain stuff to minify,
package, and upload to a CDN, etc.

- =lisp/=
- =Makefile=
- =init.el=
